# Labquake Future Prediction

## ABOUT
This repository contains Python codes accompanying the paper "Predicting future laboratory fault friction through deep learning transformer models", including Python Modules for data preparation and deep learning convolutional encoder-decoder and transformer models, Jupyter Notebooks for data preparation, step-by-step model training, and plotting prediction results from trained models.

## REQUIREMENTS
This code requires Python 3.7 or higher and Tensorflow 2.7 or higher.

## USING THIS CODE
a) Data preparation: run the Jupyter Notebooks (1) p4677_mech_data.ipynb, (2) p4581_mech_data.ipynb, (3) p4677_convert_acfiles_data_to_hdf5.ipynb, (4) p4677_convert_tfrecord_data.ipynb, (5) p4581_convert_acfiles_data_to_hdf5.ipynb, (6) p4581_convert_tfrecord_data.ipynb, (7) p4677_seismic_shear_data.ipynb, (8) p4581_seismic_shear_data.ipynb, (9) p4677_p4581_major_slip_positions.ipynb sequentially. These generate hdf5 datasets in the ./Data/ folder.

b) Model training: run the Jupyter Notebooks (1) Step1_mu_vq_latent_model.ipynb, (2) Step2_future_predict_model_inter-slip-events.ipynb, (3) Step3_future_predict_model_major-slip-events.ipynb sequentially. Modify the data parameter (num_in_time_intvl) to change the length of input AE windows and modify (num_out_time_intvl) to change the length of output friction windows. 

c) Plotting predictions: run the Jupyter Notebook Figure_3_4_Predict_Plot.ipynb for getting the models predictions for Figures 3, 4 of the paper.
